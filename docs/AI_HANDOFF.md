# Active development handoff — switch-recompiler

Branch: `claude/wonderful-hawking-10mpr0` only. Incoming verified HEAD:
`e86a3773ea06225e85a0c503b1fdad20dc3812b7` (2026-10-23).
[CI 39896893772](https://github.com/Omeruno/switch-recompiler/actions/runs/39896893772)
passed all six jobs: host/MinGW, CPU oracle, actual OpenGL/EGL reference,
ARM64/QEMU continuation ABI, Switch build and isolated JIT probe build.
This document and [ACTIVE_ROADMAP.md](ACTIVE_ROADMAP.md) are the current technical summary and implementation queue. Earlier investigative material
has been removed from the active handoff; use current source and subsystem docs,
not obsolete E1/common-dialog plans. No private hardware reports are reproduced.

## Working agreement

- Before every change, fetch/check branch HEAD, recent commits and this handoff;
  do not duplicate an active developer or overwrite newer work.
- Keep coherent commits on the specified branch; no force push. When publishing
  through Git data APIs, verify the tree matches the tested local tree and use
  a fresh expected-head lease. Git API metadata may give an equivalent local
  tree a different commit SHA.
- Run `sh tools/run_host_tests.sh` before publishing code. Use
  `COMPOSITION_GL_TEST=1` with MinGW/Mesa for the complete guest/GL suite.
  Check all six CI jobs against the exact published SHA. An earlier green SHA
  is not proof for a new change; avoid repeatedly rerunning already passed gates.
- Preserve CPU GDI/ROP/readback, software fallback, native 1280x720 Lite output,
  input routing and existing Paint behavior. UI/GDI cannot borrow guest/window
  pointers after synchronous submission or outlive continuation draining.
- Do not commit proprietary EXE/DLLs, keys or private user reports. User-supplied
  application binaries belong outside public git; public fixtures are generated
  from the repository's test sources.
- Hardware checks are deferred as one consolidated list. Continue independent
  software work without waiting for user confirmation. Never invent physical
  Switch acceptance, timing, input-to-photon latency or hardware percentages.
- Update this document and the map with actual outcomes and one concrete next
  step. Historical architecture notes may describe v1, not the current runtime.

## Current runtime and compatibility boundary

Bounded Stage C is accepted: one Process, scheduled guest threads, per-thread
TEB/TLS, waits/HANDLE rights/lifetime, APCs/timers, GUI ownership and controlled
startup/exit/cancellation. See [STAGE_C_ACCEPTANCE.md](STAGE_C_ACCEPTANCE.md).
Cross-process security/namespace, complete NT semantics and arbitrary forced
thread termination are not included in that acceptance.

Stage D loader/API work includes dynamic DLL/TLS lifetime and rollback, attach
failure handling and bounded SEH/unwind support. Extend it for reproducible
application incompatibilities; do not claim full Windows compatibility. Follow
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and the latest implementation/tests for remaining scope.

The isolated ARM64 executable-memory probe was previously reported to return 42
on Switch. Do not request that same minimal probe again as a prerequisite.
It does not certify a full dynarec: code-cache rewrite/invalidation, instruction
cache/lifetime and fallback need their own integration checks.

Paint's earlier Open/Save functionality has user confirmation, but newer graphics
commits still need the consolidated Paint smoke. Preserve the current launch-mode
selection; do not infer acceptance of a new build from an older confirmation.

## Stage E implementation state

- E0–E4 introduced backend/software reference, retained damage/output history,
  bounded resource ownership and cleanup. Accepted Stage E remains at its last
  physically verified milestone; implemented code alone does not award 100%.
- E5 production Switch OpenGL output has a software fallback. GPU execution is
  distinct from CPU Win32/GDI semantics.
- E6 (`98de7c1`): window-owned raster surfaces and independent GL textures with
  an ownership plane. Screen DC/ROP and readback retain canonical CPU pixels.
  The 28-scene live-x86 CPU/full-frame/GL oracle covers exposure, overlap,
  activation, child geometry, direct screen access and raw DIB mutation.
- E7 (`fed7668`): window and ownership revisions avoid unchanged-tile snapshot
  work; optional allocation failure falls back conservatively. Host benchmark
  evidence and work-count tests are in
  [STAGE_E_COMPOSITION.md](STAGE_E_COMPOSITION.md).
- E8 (`291e071`): report v6 separates CPU upload/draw submission, bounded
  asynchronous GL intervals, per-plane attempted transfers and logical texture
  memory. Four query slots never require blocking result reads or glFinish.
  [CI 39896269017](https://github.com/Omeruno/switch-recompiler/actions/runs/39896269017)
  passed all six jobs for that exact SHA.
- E9 (`e86a377`): `stage_e_acceptance.exe` links the unchanged test bodies for
  six software groups in one guest Process. It writes a fail-closed summary with
  fixture identity and explicit pending hardware/real-Paint/performance gates.
  CI builds/runs/publishes this redistributable fixture. Instructions:
  [STAGE_E_ACCEPTANCE.md](STAGE_E_ACCEPTANCE.md).

Do not confuse CPU GetPixel success with physical GPU/scanout equivalence.
The deferred checklist and all measurement scope/limitations live in
[STAGE_E_PERFORMANCE.md](STAGE_E_PERFORMANCE.md).

## 2026-10-23 E8 continuation: raster and observed-input correlation

Report v7 adds outermost GDI duration counts/sums/maxima in eight categories and
input queue wait, observation-to-next-changed-output and removal-to-next-changed-
output correlation. Real steady-clock stamps are independent of guest
fast-forward. Host-only Msg/InputEvent metadata leaves the guest MSG ABI and
Win32 time fields unchanged. Motion coalescing retains the newest stamp;
PM_NOREMOVE does not create a pending sample.

A 64-entry ring holds only time/change/serial values, with drop/invalid/pending
counts. Successful output consumes samples only after newer GDI changes and a
different normalized content serial. Cursor/no-op and failed output leave them
pending; successful software fallback can complete them. No causal DispatchMessage
or physical input-to-photon accuracy is claimed. Raster scopes do not yield and
include synchronous preparation; raw guest/direct Surface writes remain outside.

Validation: native metrics tests compare measured/unmeasured pixels, exact nested
accounting, disabled clocks, bounded storage, peek/removal, output failure and
virtual-clock jumps. The complete clean MinGW/Mesa suite passed, including both
real-x86 input/capture sizes with tracking/coalescing, all six E9 groups, both
28-scene CPU/GL composition runs and scripted file/color dialogs. Header smoke
passed -Wall -Wextra -Werror -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti.

A preceding local build attempt linked against one empty object file. Separate
compilation produced all expected symbols; the complete clean isolated build
passed without a runtime fix. Its cause is not established. The initial native-
only invocation explicitly skipped unavailable guest tools; only the later clean
MinGW/Mesa invocation is the complete local-suite result. New exact-SHA CI still
must be checked after publication. No physical console result is added here.

## Concrete next independent block

F0: integrate bounded executable enumeration and cancellable/paginated selection
into the existing startup picker, then audit the actual one-Process launch/return
session lifetime before adding a desktop shell. The current picker has no entry
budget and its inner wait loop does not check applet exit. Preserve single-file
autolaunch and current guest/renderer behavior. Do not add an unused parallel
shell API or begin multiprocess isolation in this change.

## 2026-10-23 F0: bounded picker integration

E8 continuation d967733be7600af290f5206ae2a3bdb10942889c passed all six CI jobs
in run 39901899983. The active map is ACTIVE_ROADMAP.md; historical diagnostic
material is intentionally not duplicated in this technical handoff.

Continued independently into the existing startup picker: ExecutableCatalog
bounds EXE paths, directory entries, path length and recursion, retaining ROMFS/
SD priority and normal SD scan depth. The real adapter uses it, paginates 18
items, reports incomplete/unreadable discovery and supports B/PLUS/applet exit
inside the input wait loop. Cancellation cleans services before graphics/guest
startup. Normal single-file autolaunch, L mode and ZL fallback selection remain.
Native catalog/budget/navigation tests passed with -fno-exceptions/-fno-rtti.
See F0_LAUNCHER.md for behavior, scope and the actual next lifecycle requirement.

This is not a desktop/taskbar or multi-launch shell. Next: a host regression
for two sequential one-Process sessions, then explicit repeatable Process/GUI/
renderer initialization and teardown before enabling return-to-launcher.
Physical picker behavior joins the existing consolidated deferred smoke list.
Final complete local suite and exact-SHA CI must be recorded below/after publish.

Final local F0 validation: complete `COMPOSITION_GL_TEST=1 sh
tools/run_host_tests.sh` passed with freshly generated MinGW guests and Mesa,
including the new catalog regression, E8 metrics, both tracked input/capture
sizes, all six E9 groups, both full-frame CPU/GL composition sizes and scripted
file/color dialogs. Standalone catalog/navigation test also passed with
-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti. The actual libnx menu is a Switch
build/physical gate; local tests do not certify its pixels or button behavior.
