# AI development handoff — switch-recompiler

Last verified GitHub state: **342f724be035586d818ce0b62e5092a84d9daeed**, branch `claude/wonderful-hawking-10mpr0` (2026-10-21 11:41 UTC). This file is coordination documentation, **not** a substitute for the actual branch HEAD, diffs or test results.

## Agreement between development shifts
- Active development handoff: Claude finished work on 2026-10-21 and plans to return Friday. ChatGPT continues in the interim. Before EVERY change re-check branch HEAD and recent commits; never assume the SHA above remains current.
- Every coherent change gets a separate descriptive commit on `claude/wonderful-hawking-10mpr0`. Do not overwrite another developer's work or force-push.
- Before pushing code, run `sh tools/run_host_tests.sh`; ensure Switch CI build and CPU oracle remain green. Local Microsoft binaries are optional and not part of public CI.
- Never commit Microsoft binaries: `paint.exe`, `winmine.exe`, `mfc42u.dll`; they belong in ignored `local/`.
- Preserve working functionality; describe exceptional changes to existing behavior in the commit message.
- Update this file when handing development over, recording HEAD, outcomes, tests and unfinished investigations. No speculative claims of success.

## Verified state from Claude's last message and GitHub
- Latest Claude commit `342f724`: Switch allows launching Paint on the **new** UI layer by holding **L** at startup; `mfc42u.dll` must be beside `paint.exe`. This is a testing override, **not** yet the default path.
- CI run [39593798846](https://github.com/Omeruno/switch-recompiler/actions/runs/39593798846): host-tests, CPU oracle and Switch build completed successfully. Artifact name `switch-recompiler-nro`.
- Reported local inspection command: `cd local && ../build-host/winrun --new-ui -f 60 -s 50 out.ppm paint.exe`; `-t` enables Win32 call tracing. These local binaries are unavailable through GitHub.
- **Known unfinished feature:** common Open / Save As dialogs via `comdlg32.dll`. Do not switch Paint to new UI by default until this functionality is validated.
- Existing new UI: `source/win32/user32_dialog.cpp` handles Win32 dialog templates; `source/win32/user32_*.cpp` provides UI; `source/ui/` is software graphics; `source/runtime/files.cpp` supplies VFS; `source/win32/kernel32_file.cpp` supplies file API. The loader lists `comdlg32.dll` among system HLE modules, but no standalone comdlg32 module was present at this checkpoint.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes historical v1 and should **not** be trusted as the current v2 architecture without verification.

## Next work item: common file dialogs
1. Audit existing imports and file-system/path semantics. Investigate what Paint calls on Open and Save As; collect trace if needed.
2. Implement a minimal **general** comdlg32 Win32 API layer (GetOpenFileNameA/W and GetSaveFileNameA/W), including correct 32-bit OPENFILENAME structures, flags, filters, nMaxFile, dialog owner, cancel behavior, CommDlgExtendedError and output file path semantics.
3. Reuse the existing new USER32 dialog, list/edit/button controls, VFS directory enumeration and common drawing. Avoid hard-coded Paint paths or UI coordinates.
4. Provide guest Win32 regression tests for positive selection, cancel, buffer too small, filter and extension behavior, ANSI/Wide strings, valid/invalid directories. Verify non-Paint apps too.
5. Run host tests, CPU oracle and Switch build. Mark actual Switch behavior separately (requires user's hardware validation).
6. Only **after** Open/Save As work and Paint hardware verification, consider changing the default Paint UI path.

## Future roadmap (planning, not completed)
- Thread model: per-thread x86 registers, stack, TEB/TLS, wait objects, scheduling and synchronization.
- Persistent Windows-style C: drive / directories, registry and process isolation; installers and archive extraction after robust file semantics.
- CRT / COM / game graphics / DirectX / JVM / CLR / PhysX only after dependency-specific feasibility assessments; do not imply binary DLL copying is sufficient.

## Handoff log
- **2026-10-21, ChatGPT incoming:** reviewed Claude's final message, commit `342f724`, CI run results, UI dialogs, VFS and host-function interfaces. GitHub source was accessed read-only prior to creating this document. No code/behavior changes made in this handoff commit.
- **For Claude on Friday:** read this file plus commits after `342f724`; check CI and hardware notes, then coordinate the next task with the user.
